#Rust Differences
1. All Variables are by default Immutable, to change to mutable add *mut* before the name.
2. If we are declaring any variable as **const** instead of **let** it cannot be changed to mutable by adding *mut*.
3. constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime
4. Underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability. 100_000 is perfectly valid numeric.
5. cannot loop through tuples
